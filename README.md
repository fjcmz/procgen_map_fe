# Procedural Fantasy Map Generator

A browser-based procedural fantasy map generator that creates detailed, interactive maps with terrain, rivers, roads, cities, kingdoms, and multi-century civilizational history — all from a single seed value.

## Demo

Deployed at: [https://fjcmz.github.io/procgen_map_fe/](https://fjcmz.github.io/procgen_map_fe/)

## Features

- **Seed-based generation** — reproducible maps from any seed string
- **Configurable detail** — cell count from 500 to 100,000 for fast previews or high-detail renders
- **Water ratio** — slider to control the percentage of water vs land (0–100%)
- **Rich terrain** — 18 biome types classified via a Whittaker diagram (elevation × moisture)
- **Hydrology** — rivers generated from drainage accumulation with flow-scaled widths
- **History simulation** — optional multi-century timeline: countries form, go to war, conquer territory, and collapse; cities and kingdoms are derived from this simulation
- **Settlements** — capitals and cities placed on suitable terrain (coast, rivers, flat land), connected by roads via A* pathfinding
- **Kingdoms** — territory assignment with color-coded borders, driven by historical simulation
- **Timeline scrubber** — interactive year slider to replay how kingdoms rose and fell
- **Interactive viewport** — zoom/pan via mouse wheel, touch pinch, or middle-click drag
- **Layer toggles** — show/hide rivers, roads, kingdom borders, city icons, labels, and the biome legend
- **Collapsible controls** — the generation parameters panel can be collapsed to a minimal title bar to free up screen space

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Generation Pipeline

1. **Voronoi cells** — evenly-distributed cells via Delaunay triangulation + Lloyd relaxation
2. **Elevation** — multi-octave FBM noise with radial island falloff; elevations normalized so the highest point always reaches 1.0; sea level derived by ranking cells so the exact requested water ratio is always achieved
3. **Moisture** — separate FBM noise layer with coastal humidity boost
4. **Biomes** — Whittaker diagram classification into 18 terrain types
5. **Rivers** — water flow accumulation determines river paths and widths
6. **History** *(optional)* — if enabled, simulates N years of civilizational history: places capitals/cities on suitable terrain, BFS-assigns initial kingdoms, then runs a year-by-year event loop (wars, conquests, merges, collapses); cities and kingdom borders are derived entirely from this step
7. **Roads** *(history only)* — A* pathfinding connects history-generated cities across the terrain

If history is **disabled**, steps 6–7 are skipped and the map shows terrain only (no cities, roads, or kingdoms).

## Architecture Notes

- Map generation runs in a **Web Worker** to keep the UI responsive; progress events drive the loading bar.
- The **Mulberry32 PRNG** ensures fully deterministic output from any seed string — including history events.
- Canvas is rendered at native pixel density to avoid blurriness on high-DPI displays.
- Cities and kingdoms are **only generated when history is enabled** — they are outputs of the history simulation, not independent pipeline steps.
- The Timeline scrubber reconstructs cell ownership at any year using decade snapshots + sparse annual deltas, avoiding full replay on every drag.
